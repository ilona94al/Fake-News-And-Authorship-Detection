## **BERT installation**
‚óè	Download BERT encoder from: https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_cased_L-12_H-768_A-12/3

‚óè	Download BERT preprocessor from: https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_cased_preprocess/3

‚óè	Create in root directory a new folder "BERT" and inside create two folders "encoder" and "preprocessor".

‚óè	Unzip and paste en—Åoder files into BERT/encoder directory.

‚óè   Unzip and paste preprocessor files into BERT/preprocessor directory.


## **Requirements**
Run: pip install requirements.txt

üí° if TensorFlow-text installation was failed try: pip install -q -U tensorflow-text

üí° if tf-models-official installation was failed try: pip install -q tf-models-official

## **Running**
